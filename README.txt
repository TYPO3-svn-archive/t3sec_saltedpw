= Implementation =
This extension uses Portable PHP password hashing framework [1]
to create salted hashed passwords. The framework has been properly
tested and reviewed. The framework is used amongst others by
Drupal CMS and Wordpress.
By that, you could import or export user accounts between
these applications without having to change passwords.


= Integration =
 * FE authentication service that works with hashed passwords
 * (JS)/PHP eval functions that allows creation of hashed passwords in BE
 * "forgot password" functionality for sysext felogin
 * "forgot password" functionality for ext feuser_admin
 * create user/edit user functionality in regards to password field for ext feuser_admin


= Extension configuration variables =
 * onlyAuthService
	If enabled, the provided service is the only authentication service for FE users.
	This means when authentication fails with this service, no other one will be tried to use.
 * forcePHPasswd
	If enabled, authentication will only work with passwords generated by provided
	Portable PHP password hashing framework. Neither existing passwords (clear-text, md5)
	nor updated ones (see section "Update existing FE user records") will be used for
	authentication.
 * updatePasswd
	If enabled, FE user passwords will be converted to passwords of
	Portable PHP password hashing framework during authentication.
	(This will not work if forcePHPasswd is activated)


= Update existing FE user records =
Note: If you've been tested previous versions of this extension (version <=0.0.3),
		you will need to convert passwords back to clear-text or md5 ones.
After installing the extension, you are able to update the existing passwords
of FE users so that Portable PHP password hashing framwork could use them.
There's a detection mechanism that tries to find out if an update is needed.
If so, you will find function "UPDATE!"  when extension has been selection
(just to help you: other functions would be "Information", "Edit files", "Backup/Delete")
Due to security reasons, the extension's service won't use these updated passwords
by default. If you would like to use them, disable extension configuration
variable "forcePHPasswd".


The provided template is exactly that one of extension feuser_admin,
but reduced by one single line which allowed an instant login by
transmitting credentials via GET.

Usage with extension feuser_admin:
please set following TypoScript to enable usage of
Portable PHP password hashing framework:

# plugin.feadmin.fe_users.parseValues.password = trim,saltedHash

if not set, passwords will be created the common way (clear-text, md5)
and FE users might not be able to log in with the provided service
